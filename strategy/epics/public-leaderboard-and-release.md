# Epic: Public Leaderboard and Release

## User Value

A public, stable URL where practitioners and researchers can view current benchmark results and understand how scores are computed, making SA Bench cite-worthy and usable.

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Leaderboard hosted at stable public URL (GitHub Pages)
- [ ] "How scores are computed" documentation visible on leaderboard page
- [ ] v0.1 release tag created with release notes
- [ ] Leaderboard displays category-level scores (not just overall)
- [ ] Mobile-responsive leaderboard design
- [ ] Last-updated timestamp visible on leaderboard

## Technical Approach

Enhance `docs/index.html` to show methodology and category breakdowns. Set up GitHub Pages deployment in CI. Create release automation or documented release process. Add metadata (timestamp, run info) to leaderboard JSON.

## OKR Alignment

- **Objective**: O1 — Ship SA Bench v0.1 as a credible, reproducible public benchmark
- **Key Result**: KR2 — Host leaderboard publicly with stable URL and documentation

## Dependencies

- **Depends on**: scoring-and-aggregation-hardening, reproducibility-and-ci
- **Blocks**: launch-post-and-positioning (need something to launch)
- **Priority**: `High`

## Tasks

<!-- Tasks will be created just-in-time when work begins -->
- [ ] _Tasks to be defined when epic starts_

## Status

`Not Started`
