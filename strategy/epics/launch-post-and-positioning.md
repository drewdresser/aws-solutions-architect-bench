# Epic: Launch Post and Positioning

## User Value

A compelling public write-up explains what SA Bench measures, why it matters, and how to interpret results—making the benchmark understandable and cite-worthy for practitioners and researchers.

## Success Criteria

- [x] Public write-up published (blog post, README, or dedicated page)
- [x] Explains what SA Bench measures and methodology
- [x] Includes examples of tasks and sample failure cases
- [x] Clear positioning: "AI is changing SA work" narrative
- [x] Accessible to both technical and non-technical audiences
- [x] Shareable on social media with good preview/meta tags

## Technical Approach

Write launch content covering: motivation, methodology, example tasks, how to interpret scores, limitations, and future plans. Consider multiple formats (long-form blog + short social posts). Include visualizations of results and example prompts/responses.
