# Epic: Contribution Workflow

## User Value

External contributors can easily add new tasks, improve scorers, or fix documentation, demonstrating the project is usable and building community ownership.

## Success Criteria

- [ ] CONTRIBUTING.md with clear guidelines
- [ ] At least 2 external contributions (PRs merged)
- [ ] Issue templates for new tasks, bugs, and improvements
- [ ] Clear documentation for adding new evaluation items
- [ ] CI validates contributions (tests, linting)

## Technical Approach

Create contribution documentation explaining how to add tasks to each track. Set up issue templates. Add validation in CI to catch common errors. Consider "good first issue" labels to encourage newcomers. Document the dataset format and scoring expectations.
